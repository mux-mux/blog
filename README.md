## About This Project

This project was created as part of the **Joy of React** course by Josh W. Comeau. It was built to practice and apply key **React.js** and **Next.js** concepts.

## Getting Started

We begin with pre-built components and styles, but without functionality. The goal is to bring this project to life.

## Prerequiremnts

1️⃣ First, I attempt to solve each task on my own.<br />
2️⃣ Then, I review Josh’s approach to see how he would tackle it.<br />
3️⃣ Finally, I take notes on what can be improved.

## Task 1 - update the homepage so that it shows a list of blog posts

//TODO Iterate over the data read from the file system!<br />
Problem: `"fs" module not found` error when using `setState`<br />
Solution: Remove `setState` and assign `blogPost` directly to a variable.<br />
